## Requirements

### Store data without login:

1. Create new 'budget' which generates a unique code
2. User data will save under the generated code
3. To load/recover data provide the correct code
4. Allow to save PWA for a budget for easy access (but still encouraged to save copy of code)
5. If code lost then data could be removed based on inactivity or stored indefinately

### Rapidly build responsive UI using standard Boostrap library

## Features:

- Set weekly budget goals which act as spending limits for any given category you would like to monitor your spending on. Before you spend, you first must check that you have available funds in your goal and after you spend the funds for that goal they will be deducted until completely depleted the limit you have set for that goal. The goals are flexible and will allow you to overspend so you can see how well you did each week and each goal will also refresh thair funds at the start of each week back to their limits for a fresh start.
- Track repeating expenses with fixed costs such as subscriptions/bills which then can be analysed, sorted by cost, and viewed as a total cost over weekly, monthly, yearly periods.
- Track current debt, calculate interest and repayments over chosen periods to allowing setting realistic & predictable payment plans to follow. Total interest calculations can be used to compare rates with other loans for debt consolidations.
